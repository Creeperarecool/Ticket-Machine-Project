2. The value returned is 0
3. No matter what you do it will print 1 ticket and set your balance to 0
5. The only difference in the new ticket from the new machine is that the value of the ticket is changed to the new one.
6. 	public class Student
	public class LabClass
7. Yes it does matter
The Error is "class, interface, enum, or record expected"
I feel it does explain what is wrong, as it's saying that there's no class, interface, enum or record, which is expected for the code to work
8. It is possible to leave out public
11. Constructors have the class name in it and it sets the initial values.
12.
a)int
b)constructor
c)constructor
13.
a)alive
b)tutor
c)game
14.It starts with a capital and each new word starts with a capital (no spaces)
15.Yes it matters which order the words are in.
16. Yes, the semicolon is like the period at the end of a sentence
18. The Student class
19. 2 parameters, string and double
23. The difference between the two is they're both returning different parameters.
24. How much money you've put in.
25. No, the return statment is returning a parameter, therefore the name must stay the same as the parameter
27. "Missing return statment"
28. getPrice has "int" before it while printTicket has void. Also printTicket does not have a return statment while getPrice does.
29. No, this is because they're setters and not getters.
31.
/**
* Increase score by the given number of points.
*/
public void increaseScore(int points)
{
    score = score + points;
}
32. Yes
33. 
public void discount(int amount)
{
    price = price - amount;
}
34.
public void setAge (int currentAge)
{
    age = currentAge;
}
35.
public void isLiving(boolean isAlive)
{
    alive = isAlive;
}
36. It makes the price = 0 no matter what you set it to.
37. My cat has green eyes.
39. #pricecents.
40. # price cents.
42. They show different outputs. This is because they're printing different prices.
43. It does print out the same output as before. I think the %d is telling where to put the parameter and the %n is staying that the string is ending.
44. Now when you make a ticket-machine object it no longer asks for a cost.
